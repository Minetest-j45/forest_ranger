#Forest Ranger
Try get as many points as you can :)

##How to play
W - move forwards<br>
A- move left<br>
S - move backwards<br>
D - move right<br>
E - shoot<br>
Left Mouse Button + Move Mouse - look around

##Notes
If you want the music to turn back on after you turned it off, or you want to turn the fog off again, refresh the page. BUT NOTE THIS WILL LOOSE ANY PROGRESS!<br>
Shooting the zombie in the same place wont give you more points.<br>
The middle of crosshair might not actually be where you are shooting, it depends on the screen. <br>
There is a 3 second shooting delay.<br>
Bullets are where the gun actually hit, some may look low from far away and appear to rise as you get closer but that is just the camera being strange. <br>
Fog is off by default as it can cause lag, to turn it on in game and increase the atmosphere, click "Turn fog on (in game)".<br>
Fun fact: zombies dont need to turn their heads :P<br>
Another fun fact: zombies jittering/shaking is on purpose :P<br>
